This web app uses `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela`. Novela is built by the team at [Narative](https://narative.co), and built for everyone that loves the web.

## Introduction

Gatsby.js, a site generator framework based on React. 
This particular framework uses a stack called [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) which means it uses APIs to handle server-side
actions and JavaScript to handle request and response cycle running directly on the client side, in which, will be rendered
using a prebuilt templated Markup or with a build tool for web apps. 

In this post, explanation will be simplified, a more profound explanation will be available soon. 
Lets get started on making your own blog. 

## Download Gastby CLI

We will be using npm a package manager to download Gatsby cli which allows us to generate our blog within minutes by just typing single line of code.  

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```
If you dont have npm installed, start by clicking this link:
[Node Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Create the blog using Novela Theme

This command will create a folder called novela-site and transfer all novela starter files to your folder(Project dependencies included).
After such operation, your command line pointer will be transfered to the generated folder directory.  
``` 
gatsby new novela-site https://github.com/narative/gatsby-starter-novela
cd novela-site

```

## Preview what you did so far

This command will create the article page,authors page and posts,configure all the paths pointing to your files' directory 
,run the queries needed and etc when a file/directory is modified.

``` 
gatsby develop

```
**or**

```
npm run dev

```

After running one of the commands, go to this url http://localhost:8000/

**It should look like this**


<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img
    src="./images/novela-site-demo.gif"
    title="Novela Blog"
    alt="Novele Blog demo"
  />
</div>
